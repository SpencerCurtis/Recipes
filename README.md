A single screen app that fetches recipes from a remote database in JSON and displays the information in a list. Each row can be expanded to see more information about the recipe. Currently this only adds buttons to go to the recipe's source and YouTube video about it, if they exist.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I focused on making sure caching would work well, as well as general UI. It isn't super pretty but I played around quite a bit with the best way to display the information on a single screen.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

About two and a half hours. The basic recipe fetching and unit tests took about 40 minutes, while the rest of the time was allocated to cachine the images, and getting the UI to a decent state.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I feel I could have made a better experience for the user if I was allowed to navigate to a detail screen to show the selected recipe that way.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I felt limited by time trying to get all the animations to work and ended up cutting my losses where I would have much preferred to get them how I wanted them.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
